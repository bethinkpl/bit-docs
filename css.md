**Prerequisite knowledge**: basic html elements, imagination

## Intro
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of document written in a markup language (like HTML).
	CSS can improve content accessibility and readability by affecting layout, colors and fonts. Also  provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics.
	Enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content. 
	The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. 
	This cascading priority scheme is predictable. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
