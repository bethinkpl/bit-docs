# Document title

**Prerequisite knowledge**: comma, separated, list, of, documents, names

## Intro
If you wish to provide some introductory remarks about the topic, here's place for it.

## Classification / acceptance questions
Questions students could ask themeselves to evaluate their competence level.
Formulate at least one question per competence level. Do as many competence levels as you're capable of. Starting with the lowest (novice) may be a good strategy.

## Sources
Provide references to knowledge sources you recommend. Sources diversity (books, youtube, articles, courses) is desired.

## All custom stuff
If you'd like to provide your own educational content of any kind (e.g. original exercices ideas), now is the best f*** time.

**Next steps**: comma, separated, list, of, documents, names

> **Important! Document naming strategy:** 
> - Document title __should__ be a headword referencing an isolated concern in computer science field. Most of the time it will be the name of a programming language, paradigm, concept or design pattern, like for instance: Python, Web, HTTP, MVC, Service Oriented Architecture, Ansible, etc.
> - Name of the file __should__ match title as closely as possible, contain no special characters, be lower snake case, ended with `.md` e.g.  `programming_for_web.md`
> - In order to be able to connect topics in an automated manner, items listed in "Prerequisite knowledge" and "Next steps" sections __must__ match exact filenames of linked documents.
