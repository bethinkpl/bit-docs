> **Additional remarks about the template:** 
> - Document title __should__ be a headword referencing an isolated concern. Most of the time it will be the name of a programming language, paradigm, concept or design pattern, like for instance: Python, Web, HTTP, MVC, Service Oriented Architecture, Ansible, etc.
> - Name of the file __should__ match title as closely as possible, contain no special characters, be lower snake case, ended with `.md` e.g.  `programming_for_web.md`
> - In order to be able to connect topics in an automated manner, items listed in "Prerequisite knowledge" and "Next steps" sections __must__ match exact filenames of linked documents.
