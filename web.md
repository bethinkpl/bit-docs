# Web

**Prerequisite knowledge**: null

No prerequisite knowledge required. If you can see this document, you are probably aware of what computers are and that they can communicate with each other via global system of interconnected computer networks, called the Internet. If so, you're all set to begin your journey with the web.

## Intro
Web - short for World Wide Web.

## Classification / acceptance questions
### Apprentice aka _I know what Web is_:
- I can explain how does the Web work and what are its most fundamental building blocks.
- I can tell the difference between the Web and the Internet.

**Prerequisite knowledge**: DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, HTML
- I know what DNS, HTTP and HTML are.
- I can describe step by step what happens when I put `www.youtube.com` into the address bar and hit enter before I can see the results. (Level of detail really depends on You. The more specific the answer, the better. But let's say naming 5 - 7 key steps  is enough to pass that question. Describing what exactly happens on youtube servers would be an overkill :D)

### Advanced aka _I can do some web myself_
- I can register a domain and add a DNS record, that will point the domain to a web server.
- I can set up a webserver that will serve HTML documents, images.
- I can make practical use of AJAX/XHR to build a dynamic web application.
